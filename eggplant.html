        <h3><i>What Are Eggplants?</i></h3>
        <p class="contect"><b>Eggplants</b> are fruits, originally native to the Indian subcontinent and are now found throughout the world in different cuisines. In England, they are known as “aubergine”, and are also called brinjal, melongene, and guinea squash. These purple or black glossy fruits can grow more than a foot in length in wild varieties, though they are considerably smaller in normal agriculture. They reached the Middle East and the Mediterranean regions approximately 800 years ago and were referenced in England by the 16th century.</p>
        <p class="contect">There are a number of varieties used throughout the world, and they are included in cuisines in many different ways. Although they are fruits, eggplants are commonly called the “king of vegetables”, at least in India, as they are one of the most versatile and functional foods in the cultural gamut. They have the consistency of a tomato, in terms of texture and density and are a perfect addition to soups, stews, and sauces. The best part about these foods is, they are not only a flavorful and delicious addition to many meals but also a massively healthy inclusion that can help you live a healthier life.</p>
        <h3><i>Benefits</i></h3>
        <p class="contect">Eggplant is known as a vegetable having a unique range of health benefits, including an ability to help build strong bones and prevent osteoporosis, reduce the symptoms of anemia, and increase cognition. It improves cardiovascular health and protects the digestive system. Eggplant is also good for weight loss, managing diabetes, reducing stress, protecting infants from birth defects, and even preventing cancer.</p>
